title: "Project 1: SNV detection using the BWT"

**Due: Mon March 30, 2020**  
**Posted: March 9, 2020**  
**ZZZ**  

**Note**: This assignment is based on a project developed by HÃ©ctor Corrada Bravo for a previous 
iteration of the course.  However, it has been modified for the current iteration of the course.

You will implement approximate string matching using a seed-and-check / seed-and-extend strategy based on exact matching using the
Burrows-Wheeler transform. 

We are providing starter code to get you going. Instructions on implementation and code are here:

[https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/hcorrada/cmsc423_project4](https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/hcorrada/cmsc423_project4)

I **highly, highly** recommend that you use [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started) for developing your code.

To get code you will be using for this project using git:

~~~bash
git clone https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/hcorrada/cmsc423_project4.git
~~~

This will create a `project4` directory with all code and data required for this project.

## Programming Questions ##

Instructions on how to prepare your solution are given in
[project code repository](https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/hcorrada/cmsc423_project4).

## SNV Finding ##

Use your code to analyze the provided sequencing reads from coronavirus strain 2019-nCoV/USA-IL1/2020, provided in `data/2019-nCoV.fa`.
SNVs or Single Nucleotide Variants are ...

Use your code  to analyze sequences for the [neuraminidase Influenza gene (NA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_neuraminidase) of
two H1N1 Human Influenza strains.

There are two FASTA files in directory `data` of the project repository. The `reference.fa` file contains a reference sequence you will use as the target string for approximate exact matching. The `reads.fa` file contains 50 bp reads you will use as queries. Use your approximate matching BWT solution to align reads to reference allowing up to 3 mismatches.

**Question 1**. A specific mutation (H275Y) in the NA gene confers resistance to [Oseltamivir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase_inhibitors), making
the drug [less effective](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22837199). A note about nomenclature: the code H275Y
encodes a substitution in position 275 (1-based indexing), changing aminoacid H (Histidine) to Y (Tyrosine).

Do the reads correspond to a gene sequence with this mutation? How can you tell?

### Notes:

1. As we've done so far use the `Biopython` to read and import `fasta` files.
2. The `pileup.py` script in the project repository can help you answer this question. 
You can get a list of mismatches found in reads, and the number of times each kind of mismatch is observed in each position as follows:


~~~python
from pileup import PileUp
from approximate_matcher import ApproximateMatcher

# initialize object
am = ApproximateMatcher(reference)
pileup = PileUp(reference)
d = 3

for read in reads:
	# find approximate matching positions for a given read
	# assumes positions is a list (even if only a single match is found)
	# with matching positions
	positions = am.get_matches(read, d)
	if len(positions) > 0:
		# add to pileup object
		pileup.insert(positions, read)

# next statement prints out mismatching positions
# output is:
# (<position>, <reference_character>, [(<variant_character>,
# <num_times_aligned>)])
# argument filters mismatch by frequency in which variant character
# is observed, e.g., .01 means variant character has to be seen at least
# once for every 100 aligned nucleotides
pileup.print_mismatches(.01)
~~~

where positions are indices in the reference string where an approximate match for `read` was found.

## How to submit ##

On ELMS you will submit two things

(1) A `diff` of your solution and the original code posted by us. Using git you can do this as follows
once you have committed all your code changes in directory `approximate_matcher`. Note that you do not need to change code outside of this directory to solve the Rosalind problem:

~~~bash
git diff origin/master approximate_matcher > project4_bwt_code.patch
~~~

Submit file `project4_bwt_code.patch` on ELMS

(2) An IPython notebook exported as pdf or html containing your answer to Question 1 above along with code used to answer it. You have to use your approximate matching code from part I to match reads to the reference, otherwise, you are free to use Biopython as needed to answer this question. E.g., to do DNA->aminoacid translation.
